# NotifyIconSample

## Background
Years ago, I wrote ANSI C Win32 utilities using Rector & Newcomer "Win32 Programming".  
So much as possible since then, I avoided C++ and objective C so much as possible  
largely because those languages struck me as ugly.  C# is not unpleasant to look at,
but some syntax is less than intuitive and some classed do __NOT__ behave intuitively.

I intend to write filter programs that will mostly sit quietly on the notification bar,  
but pop up balloons, dialog boxes and/or frames as appropriate.
After trying to hack other GitHub repositories to suit,
first nailing the proposed user interface seems a better approach.
